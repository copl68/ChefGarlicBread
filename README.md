# Chef Garlic Bread
###Concept
The player shops for ingredients then makes and
 eats their own cheesy garlic bread. 
 ###About
 The game starts in in a player selection screen, where 
 the player clicks to choose their character. The game 
 progresses to an instructions screen. Once the player 
 presses "Enter" to continue, they use the arrow keys to
 move the character around the grocery store until they 
 find all five hidden ingredients needed to make cheesy
 garlic bread. Once all ingredients are found, the game 
 progresses to a screen for the player to click and drag 
 the ingredients to make the garlic bread by following 
 a recipe. Once the garlic bread is made, the player get 
 to eat the garlic bread by pressing the space bar and 
 can restart the game if they so choose.
